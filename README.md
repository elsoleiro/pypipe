### QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE 

This program validates your input. No characters (ABCD!"Â£$%^) or inputs with a length of over 3 digits are permitted in the entry fields. 

Please use GIS in conjunction with measurements taken directly from the main (via callipers and size of valve) in order to ascertain the outer diameter in millimetres. You can convert an inch measurement to millimetres. For example: 

3" to millimetres = 3 x 25 = 75mm 

4" to millimetres = 4 x 25 = 100mm 

Please use GIS in conjunction with your measuring wheel and tracing equipment to find the length of the isolated section in meters. 

1. Input Diameter and Length 

2. Press Convert button 

3. Results are displayed in the fields following Volume, Twice Capacity, Soft Flush, Full Flush. 

4. If the flow rates have been achieved for the time displayed, you have flushed twice the capacity of the main at the velocity of either 0.5m/s (Soft Flush) or 0.8m/s (Full Flush). 

5. Press Save for type of flush carried out. Open FlushDiary.txt in the same folder to view and attach to job.
